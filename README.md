# Spatiotemporal-Cod 🐟

This repository contains the R code used to implement the analysis and develop the figures included in the manuscript: 

> "Gonzalez, G.M., Wiff, R., Marshall C.T., Cornulier, T. 2021. Estimating spatio-temporal distribution of fish and gear selectivity functions from pooled scientific survey and commercial fishing data"  

As a guide: 
* Files starting with "M", includes scripts related with the Model implementation.
* Files starting with "F", includes scripts containing the development of the Figures incldued in the manuscript.
* Files starting with "S" includes scripts containing the work included in the Supplementary materials.

Several of the scripts are still under development and will be included shortly.
