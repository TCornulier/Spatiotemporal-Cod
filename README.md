# Spatiotemporal-Cod 🐟

This repository contains the R code used to implement the analysis and develop the figures included in the manuscript: 

> "Estimating spatio-temporal distribution of fish and gear selectivity functions from pooled scientific survey and commercial fishing data"  

Several of the scripts and a dummy dataset are still under development and will be included shortly.
